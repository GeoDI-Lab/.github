The Geospatial Data Intelligence (GeoDI) Lab is a research group based at University of Minnesota. 
We aim to generate both theoretical and actionable insights from spatiotemporal data by exploring the frontiers that bridge geospatial analytics, artificial intelligence, and social sensing. 
Integrated thinking and cross-disciplinary methods are used in our works to facilitate Intelligent Spatial Understanding and Geographic Knowledge Discovery, focusing on the human-environment complexities within socioeconomic sustainability, population dynamics, transport network, business, and public health.
