The Geospatial Data Intelligence (GeoDI) Lab is a research group at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. 
We aim to generate both theoretical and actionable insights from spatiotemporal information by exploring the frontiers that bridge:
* Geospatial analytics
* Artificial intelligence
* Human-environment systems. 
Integrated thinking and cross-disciplinary approaches are combined to facilitate Intelligent Spatial Analytics and Geographic Knowledge Discovery. Applications focus on the human-environment complexities within urban dynamics, human mobility, air pollution, transportation, public health, socioeconomics, sustainability, location business, and many more.
